# pyliccheck
Rough python license checker


Run by running `./run.sh`.
This will run check.py for both python2 and python3, which will try to determine whether all of the installed python modules have open source licenses.

Note that this depends on the self-classified licenses, and assumes that if a package is installed via RPM, it is acceptable.
